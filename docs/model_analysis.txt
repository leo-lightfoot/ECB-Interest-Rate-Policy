# ECB Interest Rate Policy Prediction Model Analysis

## Overview

This script trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict the European Central Bank's (ECB) interest rate policy decisions. The models classify decisions into three categories:
- Rate Cut (-1)
- Hold (0)
- Rate Hike (1)

## Data Processing

The script begins by loading a preprocessed dataset containing ECB meeting data. Key processing steps include:

1. Converting meeting dates to datetime format
2. Creating the target variable from the next rate change
3. Validating required columns exist
4. Generating new features:
   - Interval length between meetings
   - Market volatility averages
   - Inflation indicator averages
   - Yield curve status indicators
   - Rate decision lag features (previous decisions)
   - Political risk averages

5. Identifying crisis periods:
   - Global Financial Crisis (2008-2009)
   - European Debt Crisis (2010-2012) 
   - COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2021)

6. Creating sample weights for crisis vs. normal periods to address class imbalance

## Feature Engineering

The script prepares features by:
1. Excluding date columns and target-related variables
2. Removing non-numeric columns
3. Converting all features to numeric format and handling missing values
4. Creating a crisis-aware feature set that includes a crisis indicator

## Model Training

The script trains five different model types using Random Forest classifiers:

1. **Standard Model**: Basic Random Forest trained on all features
2. **Crisis-Aware Model**: Includes an explicit crisis indicator feature
3. **Weighted Model**: Uses class weights to balance prediction performance
4. **SMOTE Model**: Uses Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique to address class imbalance
5. **Two-Stage Model**: First predicts whether there will be a change, then predicts direction

For each model type, the script:
1. Performs hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV
2. Trains the model with optimized parameters
3. Evaluates performance on test data
4. Saves the trained model and performance metrics

## Evaluation Methods

The script uses several evaluation techniques:

1. Classification metrics:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class
   - Confusion matrices

2. Visualizations:
   - Confusion matrix heatmaps
   - ROC curves with AUC values
   - Feature importance plots
   - Model comparison bar charts

3. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis:
   - Global feature importance
   - Class-specific feature importance
   - Feature dependence plots for top features

## Results Analysis

After training all models, the script:

1. Creates a summary DataFrame of all model performances
2. Identifies the best-performing models overall and for specific rate decisions
3. Analyzes feature importance across models
4. Provides recommendations for which models to use in different scenarios

## Custom Enhancements

The script includes several advanced techniques:

1. Custom probability thresholds for SMOTE models to further improve performance
2. Two-stage prediction approach to handle the hierarchical nature of rate decisions
3. Crisis-period weighting to account for different ECB behavior during economic crises
4. Extensive SHAP analysis to explain model decisions

## File Organization

The script organizes outputs into several directories:
- models/: Saved model files for each approach
- results/: Performance metrics and comparisons
- plots/: Visualizations of model performance and feature importance
- crisis_analysis/: Analysis of rate decisions during different economic periods
- shap_analysis/: SHAP explanations and feature importance plots

## Best Practices Implemented

1. Cross-validation during hyperparameter tuning
2. Fallback mechanisms when advanced techniques fail
3. Multiple evaluation metrics for comprehensive assessment
4. Model explainability through SHAP analysis
5. Proper train/test splitting with stratification
6. Feature standardization before model training
7. Saving models for future use and deployment

## Considerations for Production Use

The analysis concludes with recommendations for production use:
1. Which model to use for general predictions
2. When to use specialized models for specific rate decisions
3. The most important features to monitor for making predictions
